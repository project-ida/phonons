Electron-electron interactions are repulsive, and the overlap makes the energy increase significantly. Here, the CO molecule has 6 images due to periodic boundary conditions that are 10 Å away. The volume of the unit cell is 1000 Å3.\n",

Note the final volume is only about 715 Å3, which is smaller than the cube. This will result in less computational time to compute properties."
